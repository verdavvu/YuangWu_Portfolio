  <h2>The Living Cultural Commons</h2>
  <p class="meta">Sixth Ward, Houston, Texas · ARCH 201 · Fall 2025 · Prof. Andrew Colopy</p>

  <div class="project">
    <p>
      This residential project envisions housing as a quietly transformative landscape,
      encouraging civic engagement and integrating art into daily life. Interwoven volumes
      and alternating curves rise toward a central tower, while a sweeping roof recalls
      waves and sails, guiding movement inward toward shared cultural space.
    </p>

    <p>
      The building hosts 32 homes, a public art gallery, and an artist studio that mediates
      between living and making. Carved passages, courtyards, and lightwells offer moments
      of stillness, framing daily life as an unfolding artistic experience.
    </p>

    <p>
      At ground level, four staircases and a central elevator core organize circulation.
      Parking and bike storage support everyday mobility, while two interior courtyards
      bring light and air into the plan.
    </p>

    <p>
      The inhabitable curved roof creates double-height residential spaces and a top-floor
      shared lounge, gym, and work area overlooking the courtyards.
    </p>

  <h2>Humanized Design in Commercial Center</h2>
  <p class="meta">MixC Commercial Center, Shanghai · Nihon Sekkei · Summer 2025</p>

  <div class="project">
    <p>
      This project focused on enhancing human-centered design for vulnerable populations
      within a major commercial mall renovation. My work concentrated on interventions in
      the mother-baby room and underground light hall.
    </p>

    <p>
      Design additions included baby care facilities, dedicated stroller space, portable
      furniture near elevators, improved signage, floor maps at each landing, and soft,
      luminous lighting to improve visibility and atmosphere.
    </p>

<section>
  <h2>Young Arts Center</h2>
  <p class="meta">Menil Campus, Houston · ARCH 102 · Spring 2025 · Prof. Scott Colman</p>

  <div class="project">
    <p>
      Echoing the bungalow vernacular, the Young Arts Center features two slanted roofs
      anchoring the building within its neighborhood context. The project integrates art,
      education, and community through flowing circulation and varied sensory experiences.
    </p>

    <p>
      A large flexible gathering space beneath the expansive roof serves as the central
      circulation spine, accommodating workshops, lectures, and public events. Carefully
      placed windows respond to structure, light, and climate.
    </p>

    <p>
      Sectional design promotes visual connectivity through elevated walkways linking
      educational spaces while overlooking the central flex space and gardens.
    </p>

  <h2>Redesign of Fondren Library</h2>
  <p class="meta">Rice University · ARCH 101 · Fall 2024</p>

  <div class="project">
    <p>
      The redesign transforms a static academic environment into a vibrant hub for
      collaborative learning. Circular reading rooms provide quiet focus while remaining
      visually connected to the larger space.
    </p>

    <p>
      A revitalized central atrium improves circulation, orientation, and openness,
      functioning as the library’s social and spatial nucleus.
    </p>
